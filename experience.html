<!-- 				<div class="card-exp"> -->
					<p>I started out in the publishing business over 30 years ago, setting type on a Linotype for body type, and a Ludlow that made headlines from hot lead.  I stood at a Miehle press and fed sheets of paper into the platen press until there were about 1,000 of each 2 sided sheet that were distributed in our small city of Lanark, Illinois.</p>
					<p>Over the years my husband and I added employees, computers and equipment to the newspaper and had a circulation of about 15,000.</p>
					<p>I built the paper's first website in 1997 and, even though HTML wasn't very sophisticated and there was no CSS then, that's where the love affair began.</p>
					<p>There are many people who helped me learn along the way and I am grateful to them all. One is my son-in-law, a senior developer who built our second iteration of a website and showed me how to edit it as well as inspiring me to learn all I could on my own.</p>
